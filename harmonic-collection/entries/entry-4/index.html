        Autumn is a third season of the year that follows summer and comes before winter.
        It is the season during which days become colder and shorter and everything turns drab and brown.
        Trees typically drop trees during this season as they head to winter rest (hence the alternative name fall).
        The word autumn is also metaphorically used in reference to the last season in a personâ€™s career or life.
